For Temperature variable:

Temperature Mean Slope: 0.01498
Temperature Standard error of the mean: 0.00049
The mean is positive, and the standard error of the mean is much smaller than the mean itself. So, we can say that over time the temperature has increased. See the Temperature_Slopes_Histogram.pdf file for visualization

For Precipitation variable:
Precipitation Mean Slope: 0.06954
Precipitation Slope Standard Error: 0.00490
Again here, the mean is positive, and the standard error of the mean is much smaller than the mean itself. So, we can say that over time the Precipitation has increased. See the Precipitation_Slopes_Histogram.pdf for visualization

Slope map also confirms that the temperature and precipitation have increased over time in different states. For temperature variable we had lots of data points for most of the states (after filtering). But for precipitation variable, we had limited amount of data points, and those data points were only from 3 states (after filtering).

***I had the functions (data filtering function and getslope function) inside the main.R. That is because, i thought the functions are fairly simple and requires a specific columns such as state, name, lon, lat. So, i thought these functions are more useful for this dataset specifically. So, i had them inside the main.R.
*** Also, i intentionally avoided .rds and .pdf files from pushing into the repo.
*** Additionally i used a package "data.table" for optimizing the code. This script runs comparatively fast.
